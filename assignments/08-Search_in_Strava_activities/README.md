# Search in Strava activities

Using the data provided in this [dataset](../../datasets/strava_activities.json), you have to search for:

- Longest 'Ride' activity
- Longest 'Walk' activity
- Maximun elevation gain
- Lowest average temperature
- Higest average temperature
- Maximun calories
- Max speed
- Longest moving time
- Last and first activites
- Count activities

You may want to use Spark DataFrame and/or Spark SQL.

As a reference, use the lab [12 - Spark SQL basics](../labs/12-Spark_SQL_basics/README.md) and the Spark SQL documentation at https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html
