# PV energy production insights with Pig

Given the dataset [sunnyvale_pv_energy_production.csv](../../datasets/sunnyvale_pv_energy_production.csv), containing the daily photovoltaic energy production from July 2016 of Sunnyvale S.r.l. (1 day per line), code your Pig script to find out the maximum energy produced in one day (Watt-hour, Wh). 

In the dataset, colum 1 contains the day of production (dd/mm/yy) and the column 2 contains the energy produced in that day (Watt-hour, Wh).

As a reference, follow the lab [09 - Pig](../../labs/09-Pig/README.md).
